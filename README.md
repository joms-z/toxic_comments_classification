This project explores different deep learning models for this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)
competition.

Since, the data for Kaggle competitions can be used only if their terms and conditions are accepted, it is not included in this 
repo. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

The GloVe model used can be found from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The 100d model based on the Twitter data
is used.

Both the above files would be required to run this Jupyter notebook successfully.
