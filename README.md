This project explores different deep learning models for [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) Kaggle competition for my [SharpestMinds](https://www.sharpestminds.com/) application.

### Files to be Added:
1. Since the data for Kaggle competitions can be used only if their terms and conditions are accepted, it is not included in this 
repo. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

2. The GloVe model used can be found from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The 100d model based on the Twitter data is used.

Both the above files would be required under the **'data'** dir to run this Jupyter notebook successfully.

### Other dependencies:
pandas
numpy
_pickle
sklearn
keras
matplotlib

### Notes:
The outputs of a few of the cells in the notebook have been cleared due to their large sizes, as they might hinder with code readability.
